# gulp-bundle
my configuration for the build

In this assembly, it is now implemented:

css minification;
js obfuscation;
svg-sprite creation;
concatenation of scripts and styles;
image optimization;
js-code translation using Babel

This gulp setup can perform two builds:
for the developer - the 'gulp' command;
for the real project -'gulp build', from which the creation of source maps and the launch of the local server are removed.
